1. Get FreePascal installed from http://www.freepascal.org
You should only use version 2.0.4 or later.

2. If you want Lua support:
2.1 Under Linux: get and install Lua 5.1 from http://www.lua.org
I had to install readline-devel rpm package with my Fedora 3 as well to be able to compile Lua.
2.2 If you are using Windows: download lua5.1.dll library from http://luabinaries.luaforge.net and place it in the same dir where hz.exe should reside.
2.3 Finally edit CONFIG.INC and uncomment the statement {$DEFINE USE_LUA}

3. Type 'fpc hz.pas' or just 'make'.
This should produce a ready executable.
